# Data Grouping/Clustering

- Copy stuff from Iversen for now? Not able to make more progress it seems

# Feature Selection/Specification
## 

### Principal Component Analysis

- Include Skree plot or kable output from `prcomp()`
- Explain decision to include first six PCs (>95% cum. variance explained)
- Explain weighted loading metric to determine importance across first six PCs
- Identify important features based on this

# Outlier Identification

- Want to mention potential use of Mahalanobis Distance
- For now, using Euclidean distance

# Data Visualization

- Add plots visualizing important features relationships with strain/well/image
